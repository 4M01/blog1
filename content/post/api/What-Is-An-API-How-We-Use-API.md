# What as an API & how we use API

 In this post, we will cover what an API is with simple everyday examples that will help you to relate and recall this concept anytime. 
 
 You will also understand:
 -   Why we need to use API 
 -   What are real-time examples of an API
 -   How API is an umbrella term used for all kind of API [native APPs API + Web Service (SOAP + ReST +gRPC)]


This post focuses on the general term of API and touches what Web API is but entire focus is to educate that ReST API term is subset of an API, and it has more to it than ReST API.

API - Application Programming Interface
You may already know the acronym of API, but do you understand all those terms?  I'll explain each term, not in the
same order.

Let's starts with an application 
What is application means to you? 
What kind of picture comes to your mind while using this word?
 
Application is nothing but any program
running [or you can run] on a computer. 
In turn, a program is nothing but a
set of instruction given to a computer in
a language that computer understand to perform some
task.

You are reading this post in a browser running on the computer or mobile [also small pc], the browser is an application.

You can divide applications into various categories depending upon the
criteria. Simple classification criteria we can use whether the application is a desktop-based app [aka native app] like a browser, Microsoft paint, excel or browser-based apps like YouTube, Twitter or CITI  bank application that you use to transfer the fund. 

In case of Web Application, though you are using it in a browser, you are just accessing it through the browser, the application runs on some another machine[called a server]

The desktop-based application runs on your machine and you can close
at any point of a time unlike a web-application which you stop using for yourself but it keeps running on the server.

Applications can also be divided into other categories depending on thier intend and use.
Efficiency.
Phone banking app.
Communication/ Collaboration
Whatsapp
Information Distribution
New York post website
Fun
Games 
Most of the apps you can group in on or more categories mentioned above. Also, an application can belong to multiple groups.

I hope this gives you context about the term application, we will also try to group application using one more criterion but that is for later part.


Interface
Try to understand the interface as a general term and then we will use it from the context of Computing.
